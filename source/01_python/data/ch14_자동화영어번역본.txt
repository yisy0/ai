Hello, tiger-eyed cat. It is the largest and strongest beast of the family, and it is a wonderful animal with impressive golden fur and black stripes. It is dignified and elegant to hunt for food while quietly walking through mountains and forests. However, unlike its fierce image, it also has a warm motherhood that cares for and cares for her cubs.
In Korea, tigers have had a special meaning since ancient times. In old stories, tigers have surprised people and sometimes appeared as guardian deities that protect villages. In folktales, the "Cakchi Tiger" is a satirical and friendly description of the authoritative existence, showing how our people loved tigers even though they were afraid of them.
Though now endangered and rarely seen in nature, tigers remain a symbol of courage and strength. Whenever used as a mascot or national symbol for a sports team, we feel that energy and pride. Tigers are not just animals, but they are also the "symbol of strength" that lives in our hearts.
